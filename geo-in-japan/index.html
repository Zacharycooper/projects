            <h4 class="kanit-regular">Japan is one of many places that have a substantially higher count of earthquakes and natural disaster occurrences, some of which include, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, Tsunami’s and landslides. The most recent disaster being an earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.4 (on the Richter scale), this earthquake had caused disruptions within the train lines and had caused blackouts in the larger part of Tokyo, it had also caused a raging Tsunami with had killed over 500 civilians. The severity of the raging disasters in Japan is astronomical. Japan is part of the “ring of fire” which is a seismic hotspot (contains a lot of tectonic plates) and plays a big part on why Japan’s natural disasters are so severe. These earthquakes are either measured on the Ritcher scale, or Japan’s “Shindo” Scale.</h4>

                <p class="kanit-regular">Japan is a very mountainous landscape, with over 80% of the inhabitable land being made up of mountains! 
                    There are many different types of mountains in Japan such as: Fold Mountains, Fault Block mountains, dome mountains and plateau mountains.</hp>

                    <h4>One of the most famous examples of a fold mountain in Japan is: Mount Norikura a mountain, being formed by volcanic activity or by a converging plate boundary (constructive).  A famous example of a fault block mountain is mount Mimuro, formed by a diverging plate boundary (destructive). A mountain that was formed by a transform plate boundary was Hidaka Mountain!</h4>

Tectonic plates move very slowly, and push or pull on eachother, allowing incredible landforms to form. <br>2 tectonic plates colliding can create a stunning mountain, or if they pull apart you can have a deep canyon. <br> Surprisingly, Japan is in the middle of 4 tectonic plates, being the north American, Philippine, Pacific and Eurasian plate.

Earthquakes can be caused from humans moving a lot of stuff, A plate colliding and moving below another, or a volcanic eruption. Earthquakes are measured on the Richter scale, an easy way of determining the severity of an earthquake. <br>Japan however uses their own “shindo scale”, which goes from 1 – 7. </h4>

                    <h4 class="kanit-regular">Japan makes their school students do a “Earthquake Drill” once a month to help prepare them for this kind of situation. On top of that, they use certain materials in their building process and certain strategies to help make buildings more suitable for major earthquakes. Finally, Japan has ways of being able to predict an earthquake, to help prepare their citizens for potential consequences.</h4>

                  <h4 class="kanit-regular">Volcanos are large mountains, however they are often filled with magma. Volcanos can easily be classified in 3 different types. Cindercone volcanoes are the most common, and a formed by large eruptions from a single (usually cyndrical) vent. Composite volcanoes are volcanoes that are built up from erupted material. Shield volcanoes are flat volcanoes that don’t erupt often. </h4>

                    <p class="kanit-regular">Landslides are the collapse of mass after the rock and rubble had become loose, causing the rocks to fall down the usually steep mountain. Causes of these landslides can vary, some being caused by mining operations, some being caused by constant weight, some being caused by rain etc.. There are three main types of landslides.  Creep landslides are the slowest and least deadly of all the landslides as it requires the gradual movement of debris down a soft slope.  Mudslides are the movement of mud usually down a steep slope/mountain, this is usually caused by rain and is one of the deadliest of all landslides. Avalanches  are the movement of snow down a steep slope these are usually caused by the constant weight and pressure being applied to the snow (usually by snowboarders).  </p>

                  <br>
                  <p class="kanit-regular">The impacts of land slides In Japan are quite severe such as the Atami landslide, a landslide that had occurred in the Atami hot-spring resort which had killed approximately 30 people a landslide that was caused by heavy rainfall. Landslides can also cause a lot of property damage as most buildings/apartments in Japan/Tokyo are bunched together, so one landslide could take out 100 homes for people a famous example of this is the Atami landslide which had taken many buildings down. Another impact of landslides are the ruining of farm land destroying many crops and flooding the soil. </p>
